# Todo.txt manager

Uses the [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) format to read a file from Dropbox and manage todos. 

## Installation

Run `npm i && npm start` to get rolling. `npm test` does what you'd imagine. `npm run package` builds the compiled version of the app to run on your machine. Works fine on my Mac.
